## setup

```
sudo apt install stlink-tools
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

## Arduino IDE

```
Add link:
https://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json

In the boards manager search for stm32f1

Uploader:

```

confirmed working 2020-07-04.

## `stlink-tools`

Consists of st-flash, st-info, st-util. To flash a sketch:
```
st-flash write whatever.bin 0x8000000
```

**2020-07-15** I think I **fried** some of the circuits on the board. Both 3.3V out pins near the STLink connectors seems broken. use the one near the USB port instead. I also suspect some of the SPI pins don't work properly.
