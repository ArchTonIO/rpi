# random-benchmark

Tests the speed of generating random numbers using a clock speed of 8MHz

It takes 15141ms (milliseconds) to generate 100,000 random numbers.

Each random number takes 0.15141ms (15,141/100,000).


Random numbers can therefore be generated at a frequency of 6605Hz (1/0.15141e-3). 

Quite slow.
