# Audio player using PWM, SD card, and Nano

In this project, we will explore the use of low-level timer programming on the 
Nano to play a song stored on an SD card to a speaker using PWM output.

For the purposes of this demo you will need a file called `song.raw`. You can
[download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fU7viQhGI5p9GGPTPLHQ3CrVoz7BrtE9/view?usp=sharing) a song directly, or use a tool like Audacity to convert any audio
file to RAW format, single-channel, 8-bit unsigned, 8kHz sample-rate.
