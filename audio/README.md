## Music Tracks

A good song that I used for `sketch_jun9a` is available for download [here](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/BoxCat_Games/Nameless_the_Hackers_RPG_Soundtrack/BoxCat_Games_-_Nameless-_the_Hackers_RPG_Soundtrack_-_10_Epic_Song). It is a good song. A [direct download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fU7viQhGI5p9GGPTPLHQ3CrVoz7BrtE9/view?usp=sharing) converted to a mono 8KhHz is also available.
