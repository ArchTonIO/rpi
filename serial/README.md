# serial

## stm32

[serial-out](https://ide.mbed.com/compiler/#nav:/serial-out;) contains mbed code for producing serial out, using PA_9 for TX, and PA_10 for RX

## Also in this directory

* [esp32-proxy](esp32-proxy) - forwards serial communications (e.g. from stm32). Use pins labelled RX2 and TX2 on WROOM
* [picocom](picocom.md)

## Elsewhere in this project

* [stty](../0clock/0clock-1) for clues about automating with serial port
