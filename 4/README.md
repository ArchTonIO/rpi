# 4 device

Install libraries:
```
git clone git@github.com:blippy/lcddogmspi.git
```

**`lcdard`** is a low-level controller for a Nano/Uno

**`lcdesp.ipynb`** attempt at MicroPython code for ESP8266. Doesn't work, though.

**`lcdpi.py`** is a low-level controller written by me to control the device. Use it as a jumping off point to program other mcus.
