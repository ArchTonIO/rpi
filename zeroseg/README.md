SPI

**`basic.py`** is my water-down version of putting a random char (one of: 5, H, I) to the display. I use it as a migration mechanism for C and Arduino.

**`espzero.ipynb`** - example written for **nodemcu esp8266**, similar 
to `sketch_feb04b`.

**`sketch_feb04b`** sets the display to random digits. Similar to `basic.cc`
